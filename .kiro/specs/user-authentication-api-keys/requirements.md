# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive authentication system for SefTechHub's API platform, enabling users to register, authenticate, and manage API keys for accessing enterprise DeFi services. The system will provide multiple authentication options, secure API key generation, and user account management integrated with Supabase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Registration and Authentication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to register for an account using multiple authentication methods, so that I can access the SefTechHub API platform securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL provide email/password registration option
2. WHEN a user chooses social authentication THEN the system SHALL support Google, GitHub, and LinkedIn OAuth providers
3. WHEN a user registers with email THEN the system SHALL send email verification before account activation
4. WHEN a user completes registration THEN the system SHALL create a user profile with default free tier access
5. IF a user already exists THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with appropriate messaging
6. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL redirect to the dashboard with authentication state

### Requirement 2: API Key Management

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to generate and manage API keys for different services, so that I can integrate with SefTechHub's APIs programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the API keys section THEN the system SHALL display all active API keys with creation dates
2. WHEN a user requests a new API key THEN the system SHALL generate a unique, secure API key with appropriate permissions
3. WHEN an API key is generated THEN the system SHALL display it once with copy functionality and security warning
4. WHEN a user wants to revoke an API key THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate it and update the database
5. WHEN a user has multiple API keys THEN the system SHALL allow naming/labeling for organization
6. IF a user exceeds their tier's API key limit THEN the system SHALL prevent creation with upgrade messaging

### Requirement 3: User Dashboard and Profile Management

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to manage my profile and view my account status, so that I can maintain my account and understand my service limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display account overview, API usage, and tier information
2. WHEN a user wants to update their profile THEN the system SHALL allow editing of name, email, and company information
3. WHEN a user changes their email THEN the system SHALL require verification of the new email address
4. WHEN a user wants to change their password THEN the system SHALL require current password confirmation
5. WHEN a user requests account deletion THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation flow and data retention notice
6. WHEN a user views usage statistics THEN the system SHALL display API call counts, rate limits, and billing information

### Requirement 4: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so that I can control access to different API tiers and administrative functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL assign default "free" role with basic permissions
2. WHEN an admin upgrades a user THEN the system SHALL update their role to "basic", "pro", or "enterprise"
3. WHEN a user makes API requests THEN the system SHALL validate permissions based on their current role
4. WHEN a user's subscription changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update their access permissions
5. IF a user attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes and log the attempt
6. WHEN an admin views user management THEN the system SHALL display user roles, status, and usage metrics

### Requirement 5: Security and Session Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my authentication sessions to be secure and manageable, so that I can trust the platform with my sensitive data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL create secure JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
2. WHEN a user is inactive THEN the system SHALL automatically expire sessions after 24 hours
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate all active sessions and clear client-side tokens
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL require additional verification
5. WHEN a user accesses from a new device THEN the system SHALL send notification email
6. WHEN API keys are used THEN the system SHALL log usage with IP addresses and timestamps for security auditing

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing System

**User Story:** As a developer using the existing SefTechHub platform, I want the authentication system to integrate seamlessly, so that I can access all services with a single account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication system is deployed THEN it SHALL integrate with existing Supabase database schema
2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL work with existing API routes and middleware
3. WHEN the system generates API keys THEN they SHALL be compatible with existing API validation logic
4. WHEN users access the developer form THEN it SHALL integrate with the new authentication system
5. IF existing users exist THEN the system SHALL provide migration path without data loss
6. WHEN the system is active THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with current deployment processes
